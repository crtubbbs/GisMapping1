# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Caleb Tubbs

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)?
3

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |       X       |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |               |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below: 

Create a website or mobile app that generates a map using a mapping library like ArcGIS or Google Maps. The map must include markers showing useful information. The map must have the following characterstics:

You must have at least 20 markers on the map

When the user clicks on a marker, a popup must be displayed showing information about the marker. If you are using a mobile app, you can display the information in something native to the platform (e.g. Android Toast).

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

I will watch the tutorial provided by Brother Macbeth 
Youtube
W3Schools if applicable
ArcGIS website

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

Macbeth video
youtube
ArcGis website

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

A map marked with hiking areas

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

I will work on it in days that end in y

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

A technical risk is not understanding how to do what is happening. I have never heard of ArcGis and know little javascript so errors could definetly occur there. I am a big procrastinator so I may not get it done on time. I plan on getting most of it completed in the first week even though it is a short week.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.

No

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|        8          |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
The late week made this module especially hard for me because of the other classes that I have. The best thing I did was when I would sit down and do the work when I could. I would do my best to not get distracted and only work on my project.
